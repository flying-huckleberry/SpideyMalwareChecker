# Spidey Malware Checker Windows

After reading [This Article](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/discord-spidey-bot-malware-is-stealing-usernames-passwords) I thought it would be pertinent to write a Windows batch script to tell the user straightaway if they are infected or not, purely based on the solution given at the bottom of the article.

It will count the lines in 2 files, in different discord directories within AppData, both called `index.js`.  If either of the files have line counts greater than 1, that means the user is potentially infected, and so it will provide a positive result, that the user is INFECTED.  If both line counts are 1, the user is clean.
